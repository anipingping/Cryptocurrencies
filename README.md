# Cryptocurrencies
## Purpose of the Repository --
The purpose of this repository is to store an .ipynb file containing a code that preprocesses a data file, reduces data dimensions using PCA, clusters the data using K-means and provides visualizations of the analysis of cryptocurrencies.
## What was Accomplished --
The .ipynb file in this repository contains deliverables 1-3. I unfortunately didn't have time in my schedule to complete Deliverable 4 for this challenge.
